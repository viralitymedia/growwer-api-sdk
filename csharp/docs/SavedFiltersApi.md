# **CountSavedFilterMedias**
> CountSavedFilterMedias200Response CountSavedFilterMedias (Guid id, Guid filterId)

Count the medias of a saved filter

How many medias of the project's catalogue one of your saved filters matches: the `total` of GET /projects/{id}/medias with its `savedFilterId`. The number is cached for up to 24 hours, and it can differ from the count the web shows, which is not limited to the project's catalogue. A filter saved on the web that uses a filter the API does not support is refused with 422 `saved_filter_unsupported`. The catalogue access and the daily limit of the catalogue apply: a count costs one unit of that limit the first time a filter is counted in a UTC day, and counting the same filter again that day is free.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Net.Http;
using Growwer.Api.Api;
using Growwer.Api.Client;
using Growwer.Api.Model;

            // Configure Bearer token for authorization: apiKey
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN";

            // create instances of HttpClient, HttpClientHandler to be reused later with different Api classes
            HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
            HttpClientHandler httpClientHandler = new HttpClientHandler();
            var apiInstance = new SavedFiltersApi(httpClient, config, httpClientHandler);
            var id = "id_example";  // Guid | The project.
            var filterId = "filterId_example";  // Guid | The saved filter.

            try
            {
                // Count the medias of a saved filter
                CountSavedFilterMedias200Response result = apiInstance.CountSavedFilterMedias(id, filterId);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);
            }

#### Using the CountSavedFilterMediasWithHttpInfo variant
This returns an ApiResponse object which contains the response data, status code and headers.

```csharp
try
{
    // Count the medias of a saved filter
    ApiResponse<CountSavedFilterMedias200Response> response = apiInstance.CountSavedFilterMediasWithHttpInfo(id, filterId);
    Debug.Write("Status Code: " + response.StatusCode);
    Debug.Write("Response Headers: " + response.Headers);
    Debug.Write("Response Body: " + response.Data);
}
catch (ApiException e)

    Debug.Print("Status Code: " + e.ErrorCode);
    Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
}
```

### Return type

### Authorization

### HTTP request headers

On POST /seller/medias, also when you sent as many medias that are already registered as you may per UTC day (code &#x60;media_duplicate_limit_reached&#x60;): &#x60;Retry-After&#x60; is the time to the next UTC midnight, and medias not registered yet are still accepted. |  * Retry-After -  <br>  |

# **CreateSavedFilter**

Save a filter

Saves a catalogue search of one of your projects, which then also appears on the web. `filters` takes the filter parameters of GET /projects/{id}/medias, and `source`, with the same values; lists may be JSON arrays and flags JSON booleans. With `notificationFrequency`, Growwer emails you new medias that match. A project has at most 100 saved filters and an account 500.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Net.Http;
using Growwer.Api.Api;
using Growwer.Api.Client;
using Growwer.Api.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class CreateSavedFilterExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://tool.growwer.com";
            // Configure Bearer token for authorization: apiKey
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN";

            // create instances of HttpClient, HttpClientHandler to be reused later with different Api classes
            HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
            HttpClientHandler httpClientHandler = new HttpClientHandler();
            var apiInstance = new SavedFiltersApi(httpClient, config, httpClientHandler);
            var id = "id_example";  // Guid | The project.
            var idempotencyKey = "idempotencyKey_example";  // string | A new key for each write, reused only to retry that same write. 1 to 255 printable ASCII characters without spaces (`!` to `~`); any other value answers 400 `invalid_idempotency_key`.
            var createSavedFilterRequest = new CreateSavedFilterRequest(); // CreateSavedFilterRequest | 

            try
            {
                // Save a filter
                SavedFilter result = apiInstance.CreateSavedFilter(id, idempotencyKey, createSavedFilterRequest);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);
            }
            catch (ApiException  e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling SavedFiltersApi.CreateSavedFilter: " + e.Message);
                Debug.Print("Status Code: " + e.ErrorCode);
                Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
            }

    Debug.Write("Status Code: " + response.StatusCode);
    Debug.Write("Response Headers: " + response.Headers);
    Debug.Write("Response Body: " + response.Data);
}
catch (ApiException e)

| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **200** | The saved filters and how many there are. |  -  |
| **401** | The API key is missing, malformed, unknown, revoked or expired, or its account cannot sign in (code &#x60;unauthorized&#x60;). |  -  |
| **404** | The resource does not exist, or it is not yours (code &#x60;not_found&#x60;). |  -  |
| **429** | Over the rate limit (code &#x60;rate_limit_exceeded&#x60;), or too many failed authentications (code &#x60;too_many_failed_authentications&#x60;): with this key from this address, or from this address with any key; a valid key is never refused for it. On the catalogue operations, also when the response would take the account beyond the units of the catalogue it may spend per UTC day (code &#x60;catalogue_daily_cap_reached&#x60;): each new media costs one unit and a response that holds no new media, an empty one or a count included, costs one unless the same request was answered today while the media lists, topics and language of its project stayed as they were, which is free; &#x60;details.remaining&#x60; says how many units still fit today, &#x60;details.limit&#x60; is the daily cap that applies and &#x60;details.tier&#x60; is &#x60;full&#x60;, or &#x60;trial&#x60; for an account without a recent completed order, whose quota rises to the full cap after one; &#x60;Retry-After&#x60; is the time to the next UTC midnight, and a request already answered today stays readable. On the managed service requests, also when you sent as many requests of that kind as you may per UTC day (code &#x60;managed_service_request_limit_reached&#x60;): &#x60;Retry-After&#x60; is the time to the next UTC midnight. On POST /seller/medias, also when you sent as many medias that are already registered as you may per UTC day (code &#x60;media_duplicate_limit_reached&#x60;): &#x60;Retry-After&#x60; is the time to the next UTC midnight, and medias not registered yet are still accepted. |  * Retry-After -  <br>  |
| **500** | An unexpected error (code &#x60;internal_error&#x60;). |  -  |
| **503** | The rate limiter cannot be reached, so the call is refused (code &#x60;rate_limit_unavailable&#x60;), or a stored file cannot be read right now (code &#x60;storage_unavailable&#x60;). Retry later. |  * Retry-After -  <br>  |
