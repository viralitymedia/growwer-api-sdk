# **CreateWebhook**
> WebhookWithSecret CreateWebhook (string idempotencyKey, CreateWebhookRequest createWebhookRequest)

Create a webhook subscription

Subscribes an HTTPS URL to the events you list. Growwer then POSTs each event to it, signed as Standard Webhooks signs (`webhook-id`, `webhook-timestamp`, `webhook-signature`) with the `secret` this answer carries. The secret is shown only here and on POST /webhooks/{id}/rotate-secret: store it now. A replay of this request under its `Idempotency-Key` answers the subscription without it.  The URL must be HTTPS and its host must resolve to public addresses only: a loopback, private, link-local, multicast or metadata address is refused with 422 `webhook_url_not_public`, a host that does not resolve with 422 `webhook_url_unresolvable`. `lowBalanceThreshold` is required with `balance.low` and refused without it. An account has at most 20 subscriptions per mode. Test keys get 403 `not_available_in_test_mode` for now.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Net.Http;
using Growwer.Api.Api;
using Growwer.Api.Client;
using Growwer.Api.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class CreateWebhookExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://tool.growwer.com";
            // Configure Bearer token for authorization: apiKey
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN";

            // create instances of HttpClient, HttpClientHandler to be reused later with different Api classes
            HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
            HttpClientHandler httpClientHandler = new HttpClientHandler();
            var apiInstance = new WebhooksApi(httpClient, config, httpClientHandler);
            var idempotencyKey = "idempotencyKey_example";  // string | A new key for each write, reused only to retry that same write. 1 to 255 printable ASCII characters without spaces (`!` to `~`); any other value answers 400 `invalid_idempotency_key`.
            var createWebhookRequest = new CreateWebhookRequest(); // CreateWebhookRequest | 

            try
            {
                // Create a webhook subscription
                WebhookWithSecret result = apiInstance.CreateWebhook(idempotencyKey, createWebhookRequest);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);
            }
            catch (ApiException  e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling WebhooksApi.CreateWebhook: " + e.Message);
                Debug.Print("Status Code: " + e.ErrorCode);
                Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Using the CreateWebhookWithHttpInfo variant
This returns an ApiResponse object which contains the response data, status code and headers.

```csharp
try
{
    // Create a webhook subscription
    ApiResponse<WebhookWithSecret> response = apiInstance.CreateWebhookWithHttpInfo(idempotencyKey, createWebhookRequest);
    Debug.Write("Status Code: " + response.StatusCode);
    Debug.Write("Response Headers: " + response.Headers);
    Debug.Write("Response Body: " + response.Data);
}
catch (ApiException e)
{
    Debug.Print("Exception when calling WebhooksApi.CreateWebhookWithHttpInfo: " + e.Message);
    Debug.Print("Status Code: " + e.ErrorCode);
    Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
}
```

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| **idempotencyKey** | **string** | A new key for each write, reused only to retry that same write. 1 to 255 printable ASCII characters without spaces (&#x60;!&#x60; to &#x60;~&#x60;); any other value answers 400 &#x60;invalid_idempotency_key&#x60;. |  |
| **createWebhookRequest** | [**CreateWebhookRequest**](CreateWebhookRequest.md) |  |  |

### Return type

[**WebhookWithSecret**](WebhookWithSecret.md)

### Authorization

[apiKey](../README.md#apiKey)

### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: application/json
 - **Accept**: application/json


### HTTP response details
| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **201** | The subscription and its signing secret. |  -  |
| **400** | The write has no &#x60;Idempotency-Key&#x60; header (code &#x60;idempotency_key_required&#x60;), the header is not 1 to 255 printable ASCII characters without spaces (code &#x60;invalid_idempotency_key&#x60;), or the body is not a JSON object (code &#x60;invalid_json&#x60;). |  -  |
| **401** | The API key is missing, malformed, unknown, revoked or expired, or its account cannot sign in (code &#x60;unauthorized&#x60;). |  -  |
| **403** | The key lacks the capability the operation needs (code &#x60;insufficient_capability&#x60;), or the account may not perform it (code &#x60;forbidden&#x60;). |  -  |
| **409** | The account already has 20 subscriptions in this mode (code &#x60;webhook_limit_reached&#x60;, with &#x60;details.limit&#x60;), or the &#x60;Idempotency-Key&#x60; conflicts (codes &#x60;idempotency_key_reused&#x60;, &#x60;idempotency_request_in_progress&#x60;, &#x60;idempotency_outcome_unknown&#x60;). |  -  |
| **422** | The body is not valid (code &#x60;validation_failed&#x60;, also for a URL whose host is a single-label name), or the URL does not resolve or resolves to an address that is not public (codes &#x60;webhook_url_unresolvable&#x60;, &#x60;webhook_url_not_public&#x60;). |  -  |
| **429** | Over the rate limit (code &#x60;rate_limit_exceeded&#x60;), or too many failed authentications (code &#x60;too_many_failed_authentications&#x60;): with this key from this address, or from this address with any key; a valid key is never refused for it. On the catalogue operations, also when the response would take the account beyond the units of the catalogue it may spend per UTC day (code &#x60;catalogue_daily_cap_reached&#x60;): each new media costs one unit and a response that holds no new media, an empty one or a count included, costs one unless the same request was answered today while the media lists, topics and language of its project stayed as they were, which is free; &#x60;details.remaining&#x60; says how many units still fit today, &#x60;details.limit&#x60; is the daily cap that applies and &#x60;details.tier&#x60; is &#x60;full&#x60;, or &#x60;trial&#x60; for an account without a recent completed order, whose quota rises to the full cap after one; &#x60;Retry-After&#x60; is the time to the next UTC midnight, and a request already answered today stays readable. On the managed service requests, also when you sent as many requests of that kind as you may per UTC day (code &#x60;managed_service_request_limit_reached&#x60;): &#x60;Retry-After&#x60; is the time to the next UTC midnight. On POST /seller/medias, also when you sent as many medias that are already registered as you may per UTC day (code &#x60;media_duplicate_limit_reached&#x60;): &#x60;Retry-After&#x60; is the time to the next UTC midnight, and medias not registered yet are still accepted. On POST /webhooks/{id}/test and POST /webhooks/{id}/deliveries/{deliveryId}/redeliver, also when the subscription took 10 test events and redeliveries in the last hour (code &#x60;webhook_send_limit_reached&#x60;): &#x60;details.limit&#x60; is that limit and &#x60;Retry-After&#x60; the time until the next one fits. |  * Retry-After -  <br>  |
| **500** | An unexpected error (code &#x60;internal_error&#x60;). |  -  |
| **503** | The rate limiter cannot be reached, so the call is refused (code &#x60;rate_limit_unavailable&#x60;), or a stored file cannot be read right now (code &#x60;storage_unavailable&#x60;). On POST /webhooks/{id}/test, also when the test event cannot be recorded, so nothing was sent (code &#x60;webhook_test_unavailable&#x60;): the attempt still counts toward the 10 test events and redeliveries an hour, and a retry needs a new &#x60;Idempotency-Key&#x60;. Retry later. |  * Retry-After -  <br>  |

# **RedeliverWebhook**
> WebhookDelivery RedeliverWebhook (Guid id, Guid deliveryId, string idempotencyKey)

Redeliver a webhook event

Queues a delivery that has succeeded or failed again, in a new round of retries, and answers it. It sends the same event with the same `webhook-id`, so a consumer that dedupes by it handles it once. Deliveries are kept 30 days. A delivery still pending, being sent or waiting for its next retry, answers 409 `webhook_delivery_pending` and takes none of the hour's sends; so does a redelivery while the subscription has 10 test events and redeliveries pending, its limit for a redelivery, given in `details.limit`. The pending deliveries of events never redelivered do not count. A subscription takes at most 10 test events and redeliveries an hour: past them it answers 429 `webhook_send_limit_reached` with `Retry-After`. A disabled subscription answers 409 `webhook_disabled`.

            try
            {
                // Redeliver a webhook event
                WebhookDelivery result = apiInstance.RedeliverWebhook(id, deliveryId, idempotencyKey);

# **RotateWebhookSecret**
> WebhookWithSecret RotateWebhookSecret (Guid id, string idempotencyKey)

Rotate a webhook secret

Gives the subscription a new signing secret and answers it: it is shown only here, so store it now. For 24 hours, until `previousSecretExpiresAt`, every delivery carries two signatures in `webhook-signature`, one with each secret, so you can switch without missing an event; after that only the new secret signs. A replay of this request under its `Idempotency-Key` answers the subscription without the secret.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Net.Http;
using Growwer.Api.Api;
using Growwer.Api.Client;
using Growwer.Api.Model;

namespace Example

    public class RotateWebhookSecretExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://tool.growwer.com";
            // Configure Bearer token for authorization: apiKey
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN";

            // create instances of HttpClient, HttpClientHandler to be reused later with different Api classes
            HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
            HttpClientHandler httpClientHandler = new HttpClientHandler();
            var apiInstance = new WebhooksApi(httpClient, config, httpClientHandler);
            var id = "id_example";  // Guid | The subscription.
            var idempotencyKey = "idempotencyKey_example";  // string | A new key for each write, reused only to retry that same write. 1 to 255 printable ASCII characters without spaces (`!` to `~`); any other value answers 400 `invalid_idempotency_key`.

            try
            {
                // Rotate a webhook secret
                WebhookWithSecret result = apiInstance.RotateWebhookSecret(id, idempotencyKey);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);
            }

                Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
            }
        }
    }

# **SendWebhookTest**
> WebhookDelivery SendWebhookTest (Guid id, string idempotencyKey)

Send a test event

Queues a `webhook.test` event for the subscription, whatever events it lists, and answers its delivery: follow it on GET /webhooks/{id}/deliveries. It is signed, retried and logged as any event. It normally supersedes the subscription's earlier test events still pending: their deliveries fail and are not retried, so a test right after fixing the endpoint does not wait behind them; one that cannot be failed then is failed by the next test. A subscription takes at most 10 test events and redeliveries an hour: past them it answers 429 `webhook_send_limit_reached` with `Retry-After`. A disabled subscription answers 409 `webhook_disabled`. A test event that cannot be recorded answers 503 `webhook_test_unavailable`: nothing was sent, the attempt counts toward the hourly limit, and a retry needs a new `Idempotency-Key`.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Net.Http;
using Growwer.Api.Api;
using Growwer.Api.Client;
using Growwer.Api.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class SendWebhookTestExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://tool.growwer.com";
            // Configure Bearer token for authorization: apiKey
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN";

            // create instances of HttpClient, HttpClientHandler to be reused later with different Api classes
            HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
            HttpClientHandler httpClientHandler = new HttpClientHandler();
            var apiInstance = new WebhooksApi(httpClient, config, httpClientHandler);
            var id = "id_example";  // Guid | The subscription.
            var idempotencyKey = "idempotencyKey_example";  // string | A new key for each write, reused only to retry that same write. 1 to 255 printable ASCII characters without spaces (`!` to `~`); any other value answers 400 `invalid_idempotency_key`.

            try
            {
                // Send a test event
                WebhookDelivery result = apiInstance.SendWebhookTest(id, idempotencyKey);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);
            }
            catch (ApiException  e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling WebhooksApi.SendWebhookTest: " + e.Message);
                Debug.Print("Status Code: " + e.ErrorCode);
                Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Using the SendWebhookTestWithHttpInfo variant
This returns an ApiResponse object which contains the response data, status code and headers.

```csharp
try
{
    // Send a test event
    ApiResponse<WebhookDelivery> response = apiInstance.SendWebhookTestWithHttpInfo(id, idempotencyKey);
    Debug.Write("Status Code: " + response.StatusCode);
    Debug.Write("Response Headers: " + response.Headers);
    Debug.Write("Response Body: " + response.Data);
}
catch (ApiException e)
{
    Debug.Print("Exception when calling WebhooksApi.SendWebhookTestWithHttpInfo: " + e.Message);
    Debug.Print("Status Code: " + e.ErrorCode);
    Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
}
```

# **UpdateWebhook**
> Webhook UpdateWebhook (Guid id, string idempotencyKey, UpdateWebhookRequest updateWebhookRequest)

Edit a webhook subscription

Changes only the fields you send. A new `url` is checked as on create. Dropping `balance.low` from `events` drops the threshold with it. `enabled: false` disables the subscription, which then gets no events; `enabled: true` enables it again, including one Growwer disabled because its endpoint answered 410 or failed for 5 days, and forgets its failures.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Net.Http;
using Growwer.Api.Api;
using Growwer.Api.Client;
using Growwer.Api.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class UpdateWebhookExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://tool.growwer.com";
            // Configure Bearer token for authorization: apiKey
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN";

            // create instances of HttpClient, HttpClientHandler to be reused later with different Api classes
            HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
            HttpClientHandler httpClientHandler = new HttpClientHandler();
            var apiInstance = new WebhooksApi(httpClient, config, httpClientHandler);
            var id = "id_example";  // Guid | The subscription.
            var idempotencyKey = "idempotencyKey_example";  // string | A new key for each write, reused only to retry that same write. 1 to 255 printable ASCII characters without spaces (`!` to `~`); any other value answers 400 `invalid_idempotency_key`.
            var updateWebhookRequest = new UpdateWebhookRequest(); // UpdateWebhookRequest | 

            try
            {
                // Edit a webhook subscription
                Webhook result = apiInstance.UpdateWebhook(id, idempotencyKey, updateWebhookRequest);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);
            }
            catch (ApiException  e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling WebhooksApi.UpdateWebhook: " + e.Message);
                Debug.Print("Status Code: " + e.ErrorCode);
                Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
            }
