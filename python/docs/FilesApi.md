Method | HTTP request | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
[**upload_file**](FilesApi.md#upload_file) | **POST** /api/v1/files | Upload a file


# **upload_file**
> UploadFile201Response upload_file(idempotency_key, file)

Upload a file

Uploads a document (odt, doc, docx or txt, up to 8 MB) for a later write to reference by its `id`. A file belongs to you, can be used by one write, and expires 24 hours after it was uploaded; an expired or used file is answered like an unknown one.

You may hold 20 files that no write has used yet and that have not expired. Past them it answers 429 `file_limit_reached`, with `details.limit` the number you may hold and `Retry-After` the seconds until the first of them expires; using one of them in a write frees its place at once. A file refused as invalid (422) is refused before they are counted, and a refused upload stores nothing.

### Example

* Bearer Authentication (apiKey):

```python
import growwer
from growwer.models.upload_file201_response import UploadFile201Response
from growwer.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://tool.growwer.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = growwer.Configuration(
    host = "https://tool.growwer.com"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: apiKey
configuration = growwer.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with growwer.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = growwer.FilesApi(api_client)
    idempotency_key = 'idempotency_key_example' # str | A new key for each write, reused only to retry that same write. 1 to 255 printable ASCII characters without spaces (`!` to `~`); any other value answers 400 `invalid_idempotency_key`.
    file = None # bytes | 

    try:
        # Upload a file
        api_response = api_instance.upload_file(idempotency_key, file)
        print("The response of FilesApi->upload_file:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling FilesApi->upload_file: %s\n" % e)
```

 - **Accept**: application/json

### HTTP response details

| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
**201** | The file, stored until &#x60;expiresAt&#x60;. |  -  |
**400** | The write has no &#x60;Idempotency-Key&#x60; header (code &#x60;idempotency_key_required&#x60;), the header is not 1 to 255 printable ASCII characters without spaces (code &#x60;invalid_idempotency_key&#x60;), or the body is not a JSON object (code &#x60;invalid_json&#x60;). |  -  |
**401** | The API key is missing, malformed, unknown, revoked or expired, or its account cannot sign in (code &#x60;unauthorized&#x60;). |  -  |
**403** | The key lacks the capability the operation needs (code &#x60;insufficient_capability&#x60;), or the account may not perform it (code &#x60;forbidden&#x60;). |  -  |
**409** | The &#x60;Idempotency-Key&#x60; was used for a different request (code &#x60;idempotency_key_reused&#x60;), its first request is still running (code &#x60;idempotency_request_in_progress&#x60;), or its first request failed and may have taken effect (code &#x60;idempotency_outcome_unknown&#x60;). |  -  |
**422** | No file was sent as the &#x60;file&#x60; field, or it is too large, not an odt, doc, docx or txt document, or its name is longer than 255 characters (code &#x60;validation_failed&#x60;). |  -  |
**429** | Over the rate limit (code &#x60;rate_limit_exceeded&#x60;), or too many failed authentications (code &#x60;too_many_failed_authentications&#x60;): with this key from this address, or from this address with any key; a valid key is never refused for it. On the catalogue operations, also when the response would take the account beyond the distinct medias it may see per UTC day (code &#x60;catalogue_daily_cap_reached&#x60;): &#x60;details.remaining&#x60; says how many new medias still fit today, &#x60;details.limit&#x60; is the daily cap that applies and &#x60;details.tier&#x60; is &#x60;full&#x60;, or &#x60;trial&#x60; for an account without a recent completed order, whose quota rises to the full cap after one; &#x60;Retry-After&#x60; is the time to the next UTC midnight, and medias already seen today stay readable. On the managed service requests, also when you sent as many requests of that kind as you may per UTC day (code &#x60;managed_service_request_limit_reached&#x60;): &#x60;Retry-After&#x60; is the time to the next UTC midnight. On POST /seller/medias, also when you sent as many medias that are already registered as you may per UTC day (code &#x60;media_duplicate_limit_reached&#x60;): &#x60;Retry-After&#x60; is the time to the next UTC midnight, and medias not registered yet are still accepted. |  * Retry-After -  <br>  |
**500** | An unexpected error (code &#x60;internal_error&#x60;). |  -  |
**503** | The rate limiter cannot be reached, so the call is refused (code &#x60;rate_limit_unavailable&#x60;), or a stored file cannot be read right now (code &#x60;storage_unavailable&#x60;). Retry later. |  * Retry-After -  <br>  |
