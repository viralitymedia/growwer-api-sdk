## createProject

> Project createProject(idempotencyKey, createProjectRequest)

Create a project

Creates a project for a website, as the web\&#39;s project creation does. Growwer then analyses it in the background to recommend media: the project is answered with &#x60;state: analyzing&#x60; and turns &#x60;finished&#x60; when the analysis ends. Analysis can take hours, and it never finishes when no medium matches the project, so poll GET /projects/{id} with backoff and use &#x60;createdAt&#x60; to decide when to stop.  Every value is validated as on the web: &#x60;topics&#x60;, &#x60;language&#x60; and &#x60;country&#x60; take the identifiers GET /vocabulary publishes.  Creating a project also categorises its website through an external service, as the web does. When that service fails the answer is 500, although the project may already be saved, and a retry under the same Idempotency-Key answers 409 &#x60;idempotency_outcome_unknown&#x60;. After either, list your projects (GET /projects) before retrying with a new key, or you may create a duplicate.

### Example

```ts
import {
  Configuration,
  ProjectsApi,
} from '@growwer/api';
import type { CreateProjectOperationRequest } from '@growwer/api';

async function example() {
  console.log("🚀 Testing @growwer/api SDK...");
  const config = new Configuration({ 
    // Configure HTTP bearer authorization: apiKey
    accessToken: "YOUR BEARER TOKEN",
  });
  const api = new ProjectsApi(config);

  const body = {
    // string | A new key for each write, reused only to retry that same write. 1 to 255 printable ASCII characters without spaces (`!` to `~`); any other value answers 400 `invalid_idempotency_key`.
    idempotencyKey: idempotencyKey_example,
    // CreateProjectRequest
    createProjectRequest: ...,
  } satisfies CreateProjectOperationRequest;

  try {
    const data = await api.createProject(body);
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

// Run the test
example().catch(console.error);
```

## updateProject

> Project updateProject(id, idempotencyKey, updateProjectRequest)

Edit a project

Changes only the fields you send. &#x60;rootUrl&#x60; cannot be changed; any field not listed here is refused. Changing &#x60;language&#x60;, &#x60;country&#x60;, &#x60;promotedProducts&#x60; or &#x60;topics&#x60; makes Growwer categorise the project and work out its target keywords again, in the background.

import type { UpdateProjectOperationRequest } from '@growwer/api';

    // string | A new key for each write, reused only to retry that same write. 1 to 255 printable ASCII characters without spaces (`!` to `~`); any other value answers 400 `invalid_idempotency_key`.
